I had a new experience with technology through the use of cruise control. Though I could have read through the owner's manual,
it was not a pertinent thing to look up admidst driving or durring errands. 
So looking up how to work cruise control fell into the back of my mind espessially since I thought I knew how it worked.
With the first vehicle I thought it was only one button since the button and the controls were in two separate areas.  
So my **mental map**, the representation of the functions of the car through layout and design, of the vehicle was skewed due to the separation of the controls and the button.
I never was able to utilize the cruise control on the Honda.

Now I came again on to the same problem except the buttons and the controls were all in one place.  
But my **mental model**,my expectations that I have formed about how it would work, was incorect still as I was used to setting something then turning it on.
Yet again I was stuck without the ability to read the manual, this car did not come with one, and I was also already on a long drive with a set timeline.
So through desperation I called my partner on the phone which had finally connected to the vehicle, and was given the solution.
I must turn on the cruise control before I am able to set it. Although the setting and reactivate button were in the same places as the increase speed and decrease speed 
I understood that holding the button would used the set or reactivate button and a quick click would only use the increase or decrease respectively so my **Mental Model** was correct on that aspect.
Then the button on the right deactivated the cruise control. This was a game changer for long trips, although it still allows for my mind to wander while driving.

That was my experience with cruise control a new technology to me.
