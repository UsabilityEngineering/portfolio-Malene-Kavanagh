I had a new experience with technology through the use of cruise control. Though I could have read through the owner's manual, it was not a pertinent thing to look up amidst driving or during errands, then I would overall forget. So looking up how to use cruise control fell into the back of my mind especially since I thought I knew how it worked. With the Honda I thought it was contolled by only one button since the button and the controls were in two separate areas. So my **mental map**, the representation of the functions of the car through layout and design, was skewed due to the separation of the controls and the button.
I never was able to utilize the cruise control on the Honda.

Now I ran into the same problem except the buttons and the controls were all in one place.  
But my **mental model**, my expectations that I had formed about how it would work, was still incorrect as I was used to setting something and then turning it on.
Yet again I was stuck without the ability to read the manual, this car did not come with one, and I was already on a long drive with a set timeline.
So out of desperation I called my partner on the phone, which had finally connected to the vehicle, and he so graciously gave me the solution.
I had to turn on the cruise control before I could set it. Although the setting and reactivate were in the same places as the increase speed and decrease speed buttons, I understood that holding the button would use the set or reactivate button and a quick click would only use the increase or decrease respectively, so my **mental model** was correct on that aspect.
The button on the right deactivated the cruise control and the button on the left was to turn on and off the cruise control. This was a game changer for long trips, although it still allows for my mind to wander while driving.

That was my experience with cruise control a new technology to me.
